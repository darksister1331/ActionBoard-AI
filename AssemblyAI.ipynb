            "Speaker B | [1804.22-1804.86] Okay.\n",
            "Speaker E | [1806.86-1807.74] Okay. Sorry.\n",
            "Speaker B | [1809.66-1861.98] It's okay. So Joel said like when we click in the organization afterward like you know, you want. You know ask like to put in button or something like that. But I would say like, you know, initially we just put three button here. If you. If he click in the login with zoom, he click on the login. Login with Zoom like sign in and then like in the rest of the time, you know, we will. You know, he will see every time when you come to home screen, he already connected connect to the Zoom. You are not connected to the other platform. You know. So our users will be like most of the name because nab in like technical field. You know, they just want something. They just want something like meeting. And there's just one summarize it. You know, we. We should like make it more user friendly and like more easy. Like nave friendly, you know. Jru.\n",
            "Speaker C | [1861.98-1874.86] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I. I get it. But how will we implement. How will we separate different Zoom account from different organization if we display it here? That is my concern.\n",
            "Speaker E | [1877.5-1878.06] Okay.\n",
            "Speaker C | [1879.82-1881.82] Yeah, but we decided.\n",
            "Speaker E | [1883.18-1895.1] Yeah, just one second. What he's trying to point out is next generation innovation Zoom account could be different from you know, freelance designers have Zoom account. Okay.\n",
            "Speaker B | [1896.06-1896.7] Okay.\n",
            "Speaker E | [1896.94-1905.34] So that's why he's. He's suggesting to segment it that way. Okay. And it's a good idea to think about.\n",
            "Speaker B | [1905.61-1947.7] Okay, but he. But every. Yeah, it's okay. His idea is really nice. But. But it's like every time user like has to be signed login in another account, another account, like multiple. You know, so it's pretty like. Like one kind of like you know, next like Nast Nest, we call it a Nest loop. You know, nest thing. You know. So I'm just. I'm. If I am a user, you know, if I every time I sign in in different one different one is. It's gonna make, you know, more hard. You know. So that's what I'm saying. This is my opinion. You guys are right. You know, this measures.\n",
            "Speaker E | [1949.86-1959.79] This is brainstorming. So don't worry about it. So Jeroel. Yes. I think what would be good if you and I you have a session.\n",
            "Speaker B | [1960.83-1961.31] Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker E | [1961.47-1962.83] Think about it offline.\n",
            "Speaker C | [1964.03-1964.51] Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker E | [1964.83-1975.07] And come up with a idea which you know, after the discussion. Okay. And present it to us tomorrow. Okay.\n",
            "Speaker A | [1976.75-1986.73] So what I would suggest is that we need to show the product by Sunday. So just add one Zoom button somewhere so that Idol can connect it.\n",
            "Speaker E | [1987.45-1994.41] You are right. Kashmir today accepting Zoom. We should not worry about any other button. Okay. You are right.\n",
            "Speaker A | [1994.65-2001.37] There is no organization also. So just add a button anywhere so that you guys can connect later on.\n",
            "Speaker B | [2004.81-2044.7] Yeah. Okay. And Akhtar, so I need you for testing. Okay. So these test Sunday. Okay. You have attentive. Okay. So because you will test all the signing, you know, sign in is working or sign up is working or like for. For good. Password is working. Or create account is working or not. You know, I'll. I'll share everything, all the data and all the access. You know, you will just test. His test is and if, if you get any bugs or any error, you just like write down on and you just let me know or let the J rule know. Okay. Yes.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2045.02-2060.58] He put a message. Exactly. Suggesting that he will do that. When you were doing he, he had, he had a message in the zoom whatever it is button. So aar what you suggest is exactly what A is saying. Okay.\n",
            "Speaker F | [2060.58-2061.1] Yes.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2063.58-2071.76] So two of you are synchronized. Okay. Very good. Eggie. Did you do anything today?\n",
            "Speaker D | [2072.64-2076.24] Yeah, I was testing the. Testing the Zoom authentication.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2078.24-2079.12] And did it.\n",
            "Speaker D | [2079.12-2089.92] Work and because the app on Zoom itself isn't connected yet, we need to use ISTX account to finish the authentication.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2090.16-2091.76] But you have a CX account.\n",
            "Speaker D | [2092.73-2095.05] Yeah, we're gonna, we have to connect it tomorrow.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2095.05-2099.13] Okay. So you and J should work on it and connect it. Okay.\n",
            "Speaker D | [2099.53-2100.01] Yeah.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2105.21-2106.73] Kashmir, did you do anything?\n",
            "Speaker A | [2107.53-2130.35] Yeah. So I was able to cut down the time from four hours to 30 minutes around. But like initially let's test it out. Let's wait for half an hour then I can reduce the time as we proceed like for the first, first product. Let's keep it as it is then I'll improve the code so that it takes less amount of time.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2130.75-2136.83] So on. On Sunday when you demonstrate is that 30 minute thing going to bother us?\n",
            "Speaker A | [2137.63-2151.98] I'll show the code to you tomorrow then you can decide. Then Johirul and Azizur has to use my code and incorporate it to the app. So I don't know exactly if it's going to bother us or not.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2152.38-2159.98] So you know, it might be worthwhile for you to talk to Zoe Rul about it.\n",
            "Speaker A | [2160.46-2161.5] Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2161.98-2170.06] I'm not. I'm not very knowledgeable about all this, all these things and I don't know how it. How it is going to work out. If it is half an hour.\n",
            "Speaker A | [2171.1-2182.58] No, it'll probably. There are some things which are getting downloaded and after that like let me show the code tomorrow then. Yeah, we can decide what is the best thing.\n",
            "Speaker E | [2183.22-2190.5] Sure. But it is more important that jruen understands what you. What you are doing. Okay. And.\n",
            "Speaker A | [2190.5-2192.5] Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
            "Speaker C | [2193.62-2200.42] So Kashmir, are you means using local. Have you downloaded the model in your.\n",
            "Speaker A | [2201.62-2234.21] I'll just show whatever I have done right now I can show it to you guys. So see first of all I'm downloading some stuff from GitHub. I'm using Whisper X which is by Open AI so the these downloading pips take some time, and then I have. I am. The main thing that I am doing is that when I run this code, there is something.\n"
